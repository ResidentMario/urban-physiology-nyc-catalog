    "description": "2009/10 Progress Report results for all schools (data as of 2/2/2011)\r\n\r\nPeer indexes are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High, Transfer)\r\n\r\n1) Elementary, K-8, K-3, K-2 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.\r\n\r\n2) Middle - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math and the % SpEd. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.\r\n\r\n3) High School - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50. For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency, the % SpEd, the % Self-contained, and the % overage. Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.",
