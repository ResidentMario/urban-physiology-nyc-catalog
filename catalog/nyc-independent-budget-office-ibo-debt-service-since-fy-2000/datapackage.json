    "description": "Annual spending on debt service from FY 2000 - 2014.\n\nSOURCES: IBO; Mayor's Office of Management and Budget (OMB); New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)\n\nNOTES:\n1Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.\n2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years\u2019 debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year. \n3The defeasance of $536 million of GO Bonds in 2007 for reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                                                     4The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                      \n5The defeasance of $718 million of TFA bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                           6The defeasance of $196 million of TFA bonds in 2013 reduced debt service in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                 \n7The defeasance of $65 million of Jay Street Development Corporation (JSDC) bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2009 and 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                  \n8TFA BARBs and TSASC are not included in OMB's or the Comptroller's definitions of New York City outstanding debt.  For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt. \n9In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only Series 2006-1 bonds outstanding.\n10MWFA has defeased $14.8 billion of bonds as of June 30, 2012. IBO has not made adjustments to debt service presented in the table to reflect these actions.",
