The Traffic Speeds Map is available on the DOT's website (http://nyctmc.org/ ). This data feed contains 'real-time' traffic information from locations where NYCDOT picks up sensor feeds within the five boroughs, mostly on major arterials and highways. NYCDOT uses this information for emergency response and management.",
