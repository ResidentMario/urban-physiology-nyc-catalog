    "description": "\"Ratio of Homeless Population to General Population in major US Cities in 2010. \n*This represents a list of large U.S. cities for which DHS was able to confirm a recent estimate of the unsheltered population.  A 2010 result is only available for Seattle, WA. Other cities either did not conduct a count in 2010, or their 2010 results are not yet available.  2009 unsheltered census   figures were used for Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, DC, and Boston; the 2007 estimate is used for Chicago.  General population figures are the latest estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.\"",
